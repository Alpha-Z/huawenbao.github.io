<h2><strong>Terms of Use (EULA)</strong></h2>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>This Terms of Use Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between you ("User" or "you") and Lerge Edtech Pte. Ltd. ("we" or "us"), the developer and owner of the "huawenbao"(华文宝) mobile application (the "App").</p>
<p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not access or use the App.</p>

<p><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>The App and all content and materials contained in the App, including without limitation, text, graphics, software, images, designs, and trademarks, are owned or licensed by Lerge Edtech Pte. Ltd. and are protected by applicable intellectual property and other laws.</p>
<p>You agree not to copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of the App or any content or materials contained in the App, unless expressly authorized by us in writing.</p>

<p><strong>Auto-Renewable Subscriptions</strong></p>
<p>The App offers auto-renewable subscriptions that provide access to premium features and content. By subscribing, you agree to pay the subscription fees and any applicable taxes on a recurring basis until you cancel your subscription.</p>
<p>Subscriptions will automatically renew at the end of each subscription period, unless you cancel your subscription before the end of the current period. The subscription of a new grade will not result in automatic cancellation of previous subscriptions. You can manage your subscriptions and turn off automatic renewal in your account settings.</p>
<p>You should make In-App Purchase(IAP) with the same Apple ID for one account. Do not make payment with a different Apple ID. Do not use the same Apple ID when signing up for multiple accounts, unless the old accounts will not be used any more. We cannot take responsibility for the app or IAP not working at full functionality if you use a different Apple ID to make payment, or use the same Apple ID for multiple accounts.</p>

<p><strong>Third-party Services</strong></p>
<p>The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer of Warranties</strong></p>
<p>The App and all content and materials contained in the App are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will meet your requirements or be uninterrupted, error-free, or free from harmful components.</p>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that we will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but we cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>

<p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>In no event shall we be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, lost profits or business interruption, arising out of or in connection with your use of the App or any content or materials contained in the App.</p>
<p>It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.</p>

<p><strong>Termination</strong></p>
<p>We may terminate this Agreement at any time without notice if you breach any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Upon termination, you must immediately stop using the App and delete it from your device.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to This Terms of Use</strong></p>
<p>We may modify this Agreement at any time, and such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting the modified Agreement. Your continued use of the App following any such modification constitutes your acceptance of the modified Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Agreement, please contact us at info@lergeedtech.com.</p>

<p>This Agreement is effective as of 2024-09-12.</p>
